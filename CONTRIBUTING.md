How to Submit a Pull Request
----------------------------

1. Click the “Fork” button to create your personal fork of the HeadsUp repository.

2. Create a new branch for your new feature. For example: `git checkout -b my-awesome-feature`. A dedicated branch for your pull request means you can develop multiple features at the same time, and ensures that your pull request is stable even if you later decide to develop an unrelated feature.

3. Submit your pull request, and good luck!
